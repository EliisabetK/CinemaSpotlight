# Best movies playing in Estonia

## Project setup

npm install
```

```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### To run server (change password in database.js file)
```
npm start
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).

### Important: 
Run scraper.py before running the server for first time setup to get current information
I check on this project once in a while, so the scraper might temporarily not work.
